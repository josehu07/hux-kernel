/**
 * Virtual address space layout of a user process.
 *
 * Each process has an address space of size 1GiB, so the valid virtual
 * addresses a process could issue range from `0x00000000` to `0x40000000`.
 * 
 *   - The kernel's virtual address space of size 512MiB is mapped to the
 *     bottom-most pages (`0x00000000` to `0x20000000`)
 *     
 *   - The ELF binary (`.text` + `.data` + `.bss` sections) starts from
 *     `0x20000000` (and takes the size of ELF binary)
 *     
 *   - The stack begins at the top-most page (`0x40000000`), grows downwards
 *   
 *   - The region in-between is usable by the process heap, growing upwards
