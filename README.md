Hux - An x86 32-bit single-CPU toy operating system kernel built from scratch, following [the OSTEP book](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) structure and terminology.

## Tutorial / Development Doc

I document the whole development process of Hux - its skeleton, related theories, practice pitfalls, plus everything I reckon important as a complete set of tutorials. They can be found at:

- The [**WIKI pages üìù**](https://github.com/hgz12345ssdlh/hux-kernel/wiki) of this repo ‚ú≠
- The Hux kernel dev doc PDF (identical, WIP)

If there are any typos / mistakes / errors, please raise an issue!


## Playing with Hux

With QEMU (recommended), download the CDROM image `hux.iso` and do:

```bash
$ qemu-system-i386 -cdrom hux.iso
```

(This `hux.iso` image has bot been uploaded yet. The first release of Hux is coming soon.)

Or, if you clone the repo and build Hux yourself:

```bash
$ make
$ make qemu
```

You will see the QEMU GUI popping up with GRUB loaded. Choose the "`Hux`" option with <kbd>Enter</kbd> to boot into Hux.

A random screenshot of the system at current progress:

For development setup & instructions, please check out the wiki pages (recommended). I have every single detail documented there.


## Goals

The main goal of Hux is to be **Understandable**: structured in a way that is easy to understand (not mimicking existing UNIX-like systems). OS development seems scary at first glance for beginners mostly because it involves too many hairy technical details. I admit that, in real-world systems, we must face the complexity to ensure compatibility, performance, robustness, security, etc. Yet, a toy kernel project would help demonstrate the key concepts of an operating system, including its most essential steps of development, layers of abstractions, and the ideas of virtualization, concurrency, and persistence.

Goals of the Hux kernel include:

1. **Understandability**: as stated above
2. **Minimalism**: a minimal workable core design
3. **Code clarity**: though monolithic kernel, I will try to keep the code structure modularized
4. **Experimentalism**: not strictly following UNIX flavor, not targeting at practical use

I choose to write it in *C* language with `i386-IA32` architecture, since beginners tend to be more comfortable with this combination. More up-to-date system programming languages like *Rust* are great choices for modern 64-bit OS dev (Philipp is making his Rust OS kernel [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/)), but I will start with easier settings for now to maintain better understandability. Rust itself is still "niche" (maybe not?) and you have to incorporate some of its "dark magics" to succeed in OS dev. It definitely confuses new learners.

These are general and long-term goals which I will (hopefully) follow throughout the project. I hope this can lead towards a full HuxOS which we can install on real devices and play with in the future (kept simple, of course üòÅ)
